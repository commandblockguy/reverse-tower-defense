More info on the [Cemetech topic](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=278115#278115).

To use, transfer TDEFENSE.8xp and the [CE C Libraries](tiny.cc/clibs) to your TI-84 Plus CE using TI-Connect CE or TiLP.
On OS 5.5, you will need to use [arTIfiCE](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/) to run native programs.

The source is available [on Github](https://github.com/commandblockguy/tower-defense-ce).
To build from source, run:
```
make gfx
make
```
